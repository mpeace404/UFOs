## Overview of UFOs

### Purpose

Dana, an amateur ufologist, has compiled data on UFO sightings, and would like to build a site that will present her findings in a concise and easy to read manner. By using filters for Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the phenomenon to pull specific information out of the larger database, Dana is hoping to build a resource that will help fellow researchers and convince skeptics that we are not alone in our universe. 

## Results

Visitors to the site are presented with the mission statement for the site, and the full table of data. In the top left corner is the "UFO Sightings" button that will reset all filters.

The filters are located on the left side of the page, and allow visitors to filter data by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape

## Summary

One drawback of this design is that the data does not seem to be complete, some entries are hoaxes/unverified. The design could be improved by adding a keyword search to the list of filters, this would give would be researchers more options for searching for data when they don't have the location of the sighting they're looking for. Another improvement could be to allow other researchers to add or edit information to the database, something like a wiki page; this would increase the accuracy of the information and broaden the database.
